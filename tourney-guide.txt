This document is a checklist of all the steps involved in organizing and
running a tournament. The README file should be consulted for the actual
technical details of how to run the scripts.

Note: In examples in this document, we use 0.20 as the release version and 0.19
as the previous release version.

Organizing a new tourney:
* Choose/announce dates for the tournament (usually 16 days long, including 3
  weekends)
* tell greensnark the dates (including exact times of day) so that Sequell
  will know about the tourney and !time will count down to it
  - You can commit a change to the sequell repo with the tournament change and
    it will automatically be loaded by the Sequell server, see this commit:
    https://github.com/crawl/sequell/commit/d1bcea9ec5787328fb8cf67645778f62dc22ca1d
* Decide on rules changes (usually there are at least a couple of new banners)
* Update templates/index.mako with the rules changes
* Announce tourney again, with link to the rules page

Cleaning up after the previous tourney:
* Commit the final nemelex-combos.txt file with the nchoices as
  nemelex-combos-v19.txt
* On CSZO: replace the symlink html.tourney0.19/images -> images with a
  physical copy of the images (this is so that future image changes don't
  affect past tourney pages)

* On CSZO: rename the rcfiles-cao/, rcfiles-cdo/, ... directories to
  0.19rcfiles-cao/, 0.19rcfiles-cdo, .. (so that team composition isn't lost)
  - This wasn't done for older tourneys, unfortunately

Updating the scripts:
* Change version everywhere
  - Be sure to do this before running the scripts on CSZO so that you don't
    overwrite stuff in the old html.tourney0.19 directory
* Change dates everywhere, including clan deadline and last_win deadline
  - Set the clan deadline to one hour after the actual clan deadline, since the final
    RC fetch will be done at the deadline (see CSZO setup below), and any
    fetching will take a few minutes.
* Update list of servers everywhere
* Update banner images (CanOfWorms is making these currently)
  - You always need a new banner_footer1.png with the new version number at
    least
  - The file bannerfactory.svg might be helpful for making the banners
* Banner text changes need to be mirrored in html.py
* Update list of uniques in uniq.py
* Update list of gods in crawl.py
* Update species/background/god win scoring based on the current number of each
  - See race_formula(), class_formula(), god_formula() in query.py as well as
    the rules page itself
* Update combos.txt (list of currently playable combos)
  - Run crawl -playable-json to get this data. The "combos" key has the full
    set of playable combos.
  - This data must be modified to fit the combos.txt format, which is one combo
    per line.
* Update nem_eligible.txt
  - Use the !nwon command to do this with using the smallest win cutoff that
    gives at least 110 combos, excluding nem choices from the previous
    tournament and any species/classes enabled in trunk that aren't in 0.20
  - Example command for cutoff of 23 wins: !nwon 23 !nchoice-0.19 !gn
  - Should do this again within a day of tourney start to make sure it is up
    to date
* Implement any new banners or other rules changes!

CSZO setup:
* Create rcfiles-cao/, rcfiles-cdo/, ... directories for every other server
* Add/uncomment the cronjobs that mirror rcfiles from other servers.
  - In the entry for each server, there should be an hour/time that RCs are
    fetched that falls on the same hour as the clan deadline. This is so any RC
    file changes that happen before the deadline will be fetched properly.
  - Keep in mind that CSZO uses CDT when making these crontab entries.
  - See the crontab comments about which entries to use for CAO and CDO.
* Two lines need to be commented/uncommented in LOGS and MILESTONES in
  loaddb.py to handle local logs/milestones correctly
* While testing tourney scripts on CSZO, make sure that the rules page doesn't
  have links at the top to the scoring pages so that fewer people are confused
  by the testing
  - This will automatically happen if you create the rules page (with
    update_index.py) while USE_TEST = true (in test_data.py)
* When you are done testing, delete all the player and clan pages in
  html.tourney0.20/players/ and html.tourney0.20/clans/

During tourney:
* Add names of players to BAD_NAMERS in teams.py if they choose offensive
  clan names. This sets their team name to the default team name
  "Team player_name"
* Comment out/remove the cronjobs that mirror rcfiles from other servers once
  the clan deadline is past
  - should also make a copy of CSZO's rcfile directory at that time, to have
    a fixed copy of it in case you have to rerun the scripts later
* Some players might have incorrect capitalization for their name at the
  start of the tourney. You can recreate the database a few days into the
  tournament to fix this.
  - Recreating the database after several days of tournament games can take 3-5
    hours, so it's wise to start this shortly after a new nemelex choice combo
    has been chosen. While the database is processing, no tournament updates will
    happen, including nem choice.
  - First, kill the taildb.py process, then run the database recreation command
    in the README to wipe the database and recreate all tables.
  - Start taildb.py again. It will refetch the full logfiles/milestones from
    all servers and begin processing.
* If you make any fixes to the tournament scripts during the tournament, test
  rerunning the scoring scripts locally first before rerunning
  them on CSZO, to make sure you aren't somehow losing data

At end of tourney:
* Kill taildb.py (make sure scripts have fully updated with the final results
  first)
* Write results summary and post on CDO
