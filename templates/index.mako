          <p>
            Hello all! Welcome to the rules for the
            ${version} Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Tournament. The simple part:
            Play on one of the <b>three</b> public servers (<a href="http://crawl.akrasiac.org">crawl.akrasiac.org</a>,
            <a href="http://crawl.develz.org">crawl.develz.org</a>,
            or <a href="http://crawl.s-z.org">crawl.s-z.org</a>)
            and all of
            your Crawl ${version} games that <b>start after <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20121020T00">0:00 UTC on
            October 20 (midnight Oct 20)</a></b> and <b>end before <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20121105T00">24:00 UTC on November 4 (midnight Nov 5)</a></b> will
            count toward the tournament.
          </p>

          <p>
            For players who participated in previous
            tournaments, please look at
            the <a href="#changes">Changes</a> section for a list of
            rule changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Participants in the tournament may form clans of six or
            fewer players. If you wish to be a member of a clan, you
            need to add a line to the top of one of your <b>version ${version}</b> rcfiles
            like this:
          </p>

          <pre>
# TEAMCAPTAIN nameofcaptain</pre>

          <p>
            This should be the very first line of your rcfile, with no
            blank lines or comments appearing before this line. The #
            is important to make sure Crawl doesn't try to parse the
            team data as an option.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team captain must have the name of her team and the
            other team members in one of her <b>version ${version}</b> rcfiles, like this:
          </p>

          <pre>
# TEAMNAME nameofteam
# TEAMMEMBERS player1 player2 player3 player4 player5</pre>

          <p>
            Again, these lines should be the very first two lines in
            the team captain's rcfile, with no blank lines or anything
            else appearing before these lines.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Note:</span> The team captain should <b>not</b>
            include a TEAMCAPTAIN line in her rcfile.
          </p>

          <div class="inset">
            <p>
              <span class="inline_heading">Note:</span> clan membership lines can be added to your ${version} rcfile on <b>any</b> of the four public servers.
              If you add clan
              membership lines to more than one rcfile, then the rcfile on
              the server earliest in the list CAO, CDO, CSZO will take
              precedence.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            Clan names must contain only alphanumeric characters,
            underscores, and hyphens. Once a player's username is in
            the captain's rcfile and the captain's username is in the
            player's rcfile and our script checks for updates (once every four hours), the
            players will be in the same clan.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clans may be changed by adding or removing players at any
            time until <b><a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20121027T23">23:00 UTC on October 27</a></b>, after which clans will be
            effectively frozen.
          </p>

            <h2>WINS</h2>
            <p>
              <span>100 points</span> for a player's first win. (Since winning
              is kind of the goal.)
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>50 points</span> for a player winning two characters of
              different races and classes at some point during the tourney.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>60 extra points</span> for each consecutive (streak) win
              by a player with a race that has not 
	      previously been a streak win for that player.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>30 extra points</span> for each consecutive (streak) win
              by a player with a class that has not 
	      previously been a streak win for that player.
            </p>

            <div class="inset">
              <p>
                For every game in a streak, the start time of the game
                must be later than the previous game's end time. This
                will always be the case if you play all your games on
                one server.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're playing on multiple servers
                simultaneously, note that you cannot start game A and
                game B concurrently on two servers and win both in
                succession to earn streak points.

            <h2>RACE/CLASS/GOD WINS</h2>
            <p>
              <span>2*(48+T)/(2+R) points</span> (rounded up) for a win with a given race if T is the total number of games won in the tournament before the start of the win in question and R of those T were with the given race. If a player wins the same race multiple times, she only gets the largest value of this bonus among the wins, not the sum.

              For example, if there have been 10 games won prior to the start of the win in question and 2 of them were with the same race, then the
              win will be worth 2*(48+10)/(2+2) = 29 additional points.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>(56+T)/(2+C) points</span> (rounded up) for a win with a given class if T is the total number of games won in the tournament before the start of the win in question and C of those T were with the given class. If a player wins the same class multiple times, she only gets the largest value of this bonus, not the sum.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>1.5*(38+T)/(2+G) points</span> (rounded up) for a win with a given god if T is the total number of games won in the tournament before the start of the win in question and G of those T were with the given god. If a player wins with the same god multiple times, she only gets the largest value of this bonus, not the sum. For purposes of these points we say that a player wins with a god if she reaches full (******) piety with that god without worshipping any other god first. For Xom, you must play a Chaos Knight and never abandon Xom. For "No God", you must never worship a god.
            </p>
            <div class="inset">
              <p>
	        For clan scoring, if a clan has multiple wins for the same race,
                class, or god, only the largest value of the bonus among the
                wins is used, not the sum.

	    <p>

            <p>
              <span>100-50-20 clan points</span> for deepest level reached in a Ziggurat. Completing a Ziggurat level (for instance exiting to the dungeon from Zig:20) is also noted and is better than merely reaching the level. Ties are broken by who reaches/exits the Ziggurat level first.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span>5*D clan points</span> for reaching Zig:D. (Only the

            <p>

            </p>

("Branch" here means one of Lair, Swamp, Snake, Shoals, Spider, Slime, Orc, Elf, Vaults, Crypt, Tomb, Vestibule, Cocytus, Dis, Gehenna, Tartarus, Pandemonium, and Zot.

                III: Win a game as in II, except that you must additionally enter all subbranches of a branch before you can leave it for the first time. For example, if you enter Lair then you must enter (and get the runes from) all three subbranches before you can return to the Dungeon. This rule includes the Dungeon itself - you must enter all of Lair, Orc, Vaults, Vestibule, and Pandemonium before you may leave the Dungeon.
